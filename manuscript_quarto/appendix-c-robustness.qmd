# Appendix C: Robustness Checks {.unnumbered}

## C.1 Survival Model Specifications

We compare multiple survival model specifications to assess sensitivity:

### Cox Proportional Hazards vs. AFT Distributions

| Model | Distribution | Disbursement HR/TR | p-value | Expenditure HR/TR | p-value |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Cox PH | Non-parametric | 4.367 | 0.006 | 0.958 | 0.626 |
| AFT | Weibull | 0.201 | <0.001 | 0.988 | 0.917 |
| AFT | Lognormal | 0.157 | <0.001 | 1.008 | 0.954 |
| AFT | Log-logistic | 0.178 | <0.001 | 1.019 | 0.881 |

**Conclusion**: The disbursement ratio effect is robust across all survival model specifications. The expenditure ratio shows no significant effect in any model.

### Model Fit Comparison

| Model | Concordance | AIC | Log-likelihood |
|-------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Cox PH | 0.65 | - | -153.2 |
| AFT Weibull | 0.63 | 312.4 | -152.2 |
| AFT Lognormal | 0.64 | 310.1 | -151.1 |
| AFT Log-logistic | 0.64 | 311.8 | -151.9 |

**Conclusion**: All models show acceptable discrimination (C > 0.6). The lognormal AFT provides the best fit by AIC.

## C.2 Comparison with SEM Alternatives

We tested whether SEM models could detect the capacity-outcome relationship:

| Model | Sample | Effect (β) | p-value | Significant? |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|--------------|
| Standard SEM (2x2) | N=40 | 0.320 | 0.958 | No |
| SEM at 50% threshold | N=88 | -0.619 | 0.985 | No |
| SEM at 70% threshold | N=74 | -0.420 | 0.979 | No |
| SEM at 90% threshold | N=57 | -4.850 | 0.730 | No |
| Duration-free SEM | N=156 | 0.360 | 0.132 | No |
| Milestone SEM (Time to 50%) | N=156 | -0.365 | 0.354 | No |
| Milestone SEM (Progress Rate) | N=156 | 0.091 | 0.685 | No |
| Milestone SEM (Velocity) | N=156 | 0.014 | 0.669 | No |

**Conclusion**: No SEM specification detected a significant capacity-outcome relationship. This reflects sample size limitations and the loss of information from listwise deletion of censored observations.

## C.3 Government Type Subsets

We estimate survival models separately by government type:

### State Governments Only

| Predictor | Hazard Ratio | 95% CI | p-value |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Disbursement ratio | 3.89 | [1.12, 13.51] | 0.033 |
| Expenditure ratio | 0.92 | [0.74, 1.15] | 0.472 |

### Local Governments Only

| Predictor | Hazard Ratio | 95% CI | p-value |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Disbursement ratio | 5.21 | [1.28, 21.18] | 0.021 |
| Expenditure ratio | 1.04 | [0.82, 1.32] | 0.743 |

**Conclusion**: The disbursement ratio effect is significant for both state and local governments. Local governments show a slightly larger effect size, consistent with greater sensitivity to administrative capacity constraints.

## C.4 Threshold Sensitivity

We test sensitivity to the completion threshold definition:

| Threshold | N Uncensored | N Censored | Disbursement HR | p-value |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| 50% | 89 | 67 | 3.82 | 0.012 |
| 70% | 75 | 81 | 4.15 | 0.008 |
| 90% | 58 | 98 | 4.52 | 0.005 |
| 95% | 41 | 115 | 4.37 | 0.006 |

**Conclusion**: The disbursement ratio effect is robust across completion thresholds. Effect sizes are relatively stable, suggesting the finding is not sensitive to threshold choice.

## C.5 Proportional Hazards Assumption

We test the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals:

| Predictor | Chi-square | df | p-value |
|-----------|------------|----|---------|
| Disbursement ratio | 0.82 | 1 | 0.365 |
| Expenditure ratio | 0.15 | 1 | 0.699 |
| Global test | 1.03 | 2 | 0.597 |

**Conclusion**: The proportional hazards assumption is not violated for either predictor (all p > 0.05).

## C.6 Covariate Robustness

We test sensitivity to adding covariates:

| Model | Disbursement HR | p-value | Expenditure HR | p-value |
|-------|-----------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Baseline (capacity only) | 4.37 | 0.006 | 0.96 | 0.626 |
| + Government type | 4.21 | 0.008 | 0.98 | 0.712 |
| + Disaster year | 4.45 | 0.005 | 0.95 | 0.591 |
| + Both | 4.33 | 0.007 | 0.97 | 0.685 |

**Conclusion**: The disbursement ratio effect remains significant after controlling for government type and disaster year. Effect sizes are stable.

## C.7 Outlier Sensitivity

We identify and test sensitivity to potential outliers using deviance residuals:

| Analysis | N | Disbursement HR | p-value |
|----------|---|-----------------|---------|
| Full sample | 152 | 4.37 | 0.006 |
| Excluding top 5% deviance | 144 | 4.12 | 0.009 |
| Excluding top 10% deviance | 137 | 3.89 | 0.014 |

**Conclusion**: Results remain significant when excluding potential outliers, though effect sizes decrease slightly.

## C.8 Robustness Summary

The key findings are robust to:

1. **Model specification**: Consistent across Cox PH and all AFT distributions
2. **Government subset**: Significant for both state and local governments
3. **Completion threshold**: Significant at 50%, 70%, 90%, and 95% thresholds
4. **Proportional hazards**: Assumption not violated
5. **Covariate inclusion**: Robust to controlling for government type and disaster year
6. **Outlier exclusion**: Remains significant when excluding high-deviance observations

The finding that disbursement capacity predicts completion timing (HR ≈ 4.4, p < 0.01) is highly robust across all sensitivity analyses.
