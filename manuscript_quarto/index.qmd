# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This study examines the relationship between government capacity and disaster recovery outcomes using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). We analyze Quarterly Performance Report (QPR) data from the Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program to assess how administrative capacity affects the timeliness and effectiveness of post-disaster fund expenditure. Our latent variable model captures government capacity through financial management ratios while measuring recovery outcomes through duration, completion rates, and spending consistency. Results indicate [summarize key findings]. These findings have implications for disaster preparedness policy and the allocation of federal recovery resources.

# Introduction

Disasters impose substantial costs on communities, and effective recovery depends critically on the administrative capacity of implementing governments. The Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is a major vehicle for federal disaster recovery assistance. However, significant variation exists in how quickly and effectively grantees expend allocated funds.

This study addresses a fundamental question: Does government administrative capacity affect disaster recovery outcomes? We operationalize capacity through observable financial management indicators and assess its relationship to recovery timeliness and effectiveness using Structural Equation Modeling.

## Research Questions

1. How does government capacity, measured through fund management metrics, relate to recovery outcomes?
2. Do the relationships between capacity and outcomes differ between state and local governments?
3. How do external factors (population, disaster severity, prior experience) moderate these relationships?

## Contribution

This research contributes to the disaster recovery literature by:

- Developing a latent variable framework for measuring government capacity
- Utilizing comprehensive QPR data across multiple disaster events and grantees
- Applying SEM to simultaneously estimate measurement and structural relationships
- Comparing capacity effects across government types

# Literature Review

## Government Capacity

The concept of government capacity has received extensive attention in public administration scholarship. Capacity encompasses the resources, skills, and organizational structures that enable effective policy implementation [@capacity_ref_1]. In the disaster context, capacity includes preparedness, resource mobilization, and administrative efficiency.

## Disaster Recovery Performance

Recovery performance has been conceptualized along multiple dimensions including speed, equity, and completeness [@recovery_ref_1]. Prior research has documented substantial variation in recovery timelines and outcomes across communities.

## CDBG-DR Program

The CDBG-DR program provides flexible block grants to states, cities, and counties recovering from presidentially-declared disasters. Grantees submit Quarterly Performance Reports documenting fund obligation and expenditure, providing a rich data source for analyzing recovery dynamics.

# Data

## Data Sources

Our analysis draws on:

1. **Quarterly Performance Reports (QPR)**: Fund obligation, disbursement, and expenditure data by grantee, disaster, and activity type
2. **Population data**: Grantee jurisdiction populations from Census Bureau
3. **Disaster severity**: Composite index based on damage assessments
4. **Grantee experience**: Prior CDBG-DR grants administered

## Sample Construction

The analysis sample includes [describe sample]. We exclude [describe exclusions] to ensure adequate observation periods for computing outcome measures.

## Variable Definitions

### Capacity Indicators

- **Disbursement ratio**: Funds disbursed to recipients relative to obligated funds
- **Expenditure ratio**: Funds expended by recipients relative to disbursed funds

### Outcome Indicators

- **Duration**: Months to reach 95% expenditure of final obligated amount
- **Spending CV**: Coefficient of variation of quarterly expenditures

### Covariates

- **Population**: Jurisdiction population (log-transformed and scaled)
- **Severity**: Disaster severity composite index (scaled)
- **Experience**: Prior grant management experience index (scaled)

# Methodology

## Structural Equation Modeling

We employ Structural Equation Modeling to simultaneously estimate:

1. **Measurement models** linking observed indicators to latent constructs
2. **Structural paths** relating latent capacity to latent outcomes

The general SEM can be written:

$$
\eta = B\eta + \Gamma\xi + \zeta
$$

where $\eta$ represents endogenous latent variables, $\xi$ represents exogenous variables, $B$ captures relationships among endogenous variables, $\Gamma$ captures effects of exogenous on endogenous variables, and $\zeta$ represents structural disturbances.

## Model Specification

Our primary model specifies:

**Measurement Model (Capacity)**:
$$
\text{gov\_cap} =\!\!\sim \text{Ratio\_disbursed} + \text{Ratio\_expended}
$$

**Measurement Model (Outcome)**:
$$
\text{recovery\_outcome} =\!\!\sim \text{Duration\_log} + \text{Spending\_CV}
$$

**Structural Model**:
$$
\text{recovery\_outcome} \sim \text{gov\_cap}
$$

## Estimation

Models are estimated using maximum likelihood via the `semopy` Python package. We assess model fit using standard indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR) against conventional thresholds.

## Robustness Checks

We conduct robustness analyses including:

- Alternative model specifications
- Subset analyses by government type
- Sample sensitivity tests
- Covariate inclusion/exclusion
