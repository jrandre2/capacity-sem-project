# Appendix A: Data Description {.unnumbered}

## A.1 Data Sources

### Quarterly Performance Reports (QPR)

The QPR data is extracted from HUD's DRGR (Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting) system. This administrative data captures:

- Fund allocations by appropriation
- Obligation, disbursement, and expenditure amounts
- Activity types (housing, infrastructure, economic development, etc.)
- Quarterly reporting periods

### Population Data

Population figures are obtained from:

- U.S. Census Bureau decennial census (2000, 2010, 2020)
- American Community Survey estimates for intercensal years

### Disaster Severity

The disaster severity index is constructed from:

- FEMA declared disaster data
- Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) obligations
- Number of affected counties

### Experience Indicators

Grantee experience measures are computed from:

- Years since first CDBG-DR grant
- Number of prior disaster grants managed
- Cumulative prior obligated dollars

## A.2 Variable Construction

### Financial Ratios

$$
\text{Ratio\_disbursed\_to\_obligated} = \frac{\text{Total Disbursed}}{\text{Total Obligated}}
$$

$$
\text{Ratio\_expended\_to\_disbursed} = \frac{\text{Total Expended}}{\text{Total Disbursed}}
$$

### Duration Measures

Duration is computed as the number of months from first obligation to reaching 95% expenditure of the final obligated amount. Log-transformation is applied to address right-skewness:

$$
\text{Duration\_log} = \ln(\text{Duration\_months})
$$

### Spending Consistency

The coefficient of variation (CV) measures spending consistency:

$$
\text{Spending\_CV} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{quarterly}}}{\mu_{\text{quarterly}}}
$$

## A.3 Sample Characteristics

### Overall Sample Composition

The analysis dataset consists of 152 grantee-disaster pairs from the CDBG-DR program covering disasters from 2003 to 2023. Table A.1 presents the basic sample structure.

| **Characteristic** | **Count** | **Percent** |
|:-------------------|----------:|------------:|
| **Total Observations** | 152 | 100.0% |
| Unique grantees | 78 | -- |
| Unique disaster events | 18 | -- |
| Unique grant allocations | 206 | -- |

: Sample composition {#tbl-sample-composition}

### Government Type Distribution

The sample includes both state and local government grantees, as shown in Table A.2.

| **Government Type** | **N** | **Percent** |
|:--------------------|------:|------------:|
| State governments | 37 | 24.3% |
| Local governments | 40 | 26.3% |
| Multiple/Mixed | 75 | 49.3% |
| **Total** | **152** | **100.0%** |

: Government type distribution {#tbl-government-type}

*Note: Multiple/Mixed category includes grantee-disaster pairs where a single disaster involved both state and local allocations, or cases where classification was ambiguous in the administrative data.*

### Censoring Status

A critical feature of the CDBG-DR data is the high rate of incomplete programs. Table A.3 shows the censoring distribution at the 95% completion threshold.

| **Status** | **N** | **Percent** |
|:-----------|------:|------------:|
| Completed (reached 95% expenditure) | 40 | 26.3% |
| Right-censored (not yet complete) | 112 | 73.7% |
| **Total** | **152** | **100.0%** |

: Censoring status at 95% completion threshold {#tbl-censoring}

This high censoring rate (73.7%) motivates the use of survival analysis methods. Standard regression approaches that drop censored observations would discard 112 of 152 observations (73.7% of the sample), severely limiting statistical power and introducing selection bias. Survival analysis properly incorporates information from both completed and censored observations.

### Completion Rates by Threshold

Table A.4 shows how completion rates vary across different expenditure thresholds.

| **Threshold** | **Completed** | **Censored** | **Completion Rate** |
|:--------------|---------------:|--------------:|--------------------:|
| 50% | 122 | 30 | 80.3% |
| 70% | 105 | 47 | 69.1% |
| 90% | 58 | 94 | 38.2% |
| **95%** | **40** | **112** | **26.3%** |
| 99% | 25 | 127 | 16.4% |

: Program completion rates by expenditure threshold {#tbl-completion-thresholds}

The 95% threshold is selected as a reasonable definition of "substantially complete" that balances data availability with meaningful completion. Even at 90%, more than half the sample remains censored.

### Disaster Coverage

The sample covers 18 major disaster events from 2003 to 2023, including:

- **Hurricane Katrina** (2005): The largest single disaster allocation, affecting Gulf Coast states
- **Superstorm Sandy** (2012): Affecting Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states
- **Hurricane Harvey** (2017): Major impact on Texas coastal communities
- **Hurricane Maria** (2017): Devastating Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands
- **California Wildfires** (2017-2020): Multiple events requiring substantial recovery funding
- **Hurricane Irma** (2017): Affecting Florida and Caribbean territories
- **Louisiana Floods** (2016): Major flooding event requiring state coordination
- **Multiple smaller events** (2003-2023): Various floods, hurricanes, and natural disasters

The diversity of disaster types, geographic locations, and governmental structures provides substantial variation in both capacity indicators and completion timing.

### Capacity Indicator Summary Statistics

Table A.5 presents descriptive statistics for the key capacity indicators used in the survival analysis.

| **Variable** | **N** | **Mean** | **SD** | **Min** | **Median** | **Max** |
|:-------------|------:|---------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Ratio_disbursed_to_obligated | 152 | 0.642 | 0.203 | 0.089 | 0.671 | 0.983 |
| Ratio_expended_to_disbursed | 152 | 0.891 | 0.124 | 0.412 | 0.923 | 1.000 |
| Spending_CV (coefficient of variation) | 152 | 0.847 | 0.521 | 0.156 | 0.712 | 3.245 |
| Duration_months (for completed only) | 40 | 87.3 | 42.6 | 24 | 78.5 | 196 |
| Total_obligated (millions) | 152 | $248.7 | $542.3 | $2.1 | $75.4 | $4,211.5 |

: Descriptive statistics for capacity indicators {#tbl-capacity-descriptives}

*Note: Duration_months is only defined for the 40 observations that reached 95% completion. The remaining 112 observations are right-censored and contribute partial duration information to the survival analysis.*

**Key observations:**

1. **Disbursement capacity** averages 64.2%, indicating that on average, grantees disburse approximately two-thirds of obligated funds over the observation period. Substantial variation exists (SD = 0.203), ranging from 8.9% to 98.3%.

2. **Expenditure capacity** is higher, averaging 89.1%, suggesting that once funds are disbursed, they are spent relatively efficiently. Less variation exists in expenditure ratios (SD = 0.124).

3. **Spending consistency** (inverse of CV) shows considerable variation, with some grantees maintaining steady quarterly spending patterns while others exhibit more volatile fund flows.

4. **Grant sizes** vary dramatically, from $2.1 million to $4.2 billion, with high positive skew (median = $75.4M, mean = $248.7M). This justifies the use of log-transformed covariates in some model specifications.

5. **Completion timing** for the 40 completed programs ranges from 2 to over 16 years (24-196 months), with a median of 78.5 months (approximately 6.5 years).

### Data Quality

The underlying quarterly performance report (QPR) data consists of 130,605 quarterly observations from 78 grantees across 206 grant allocations. Data quality checks identified:

- Zero duplicate rows
- Zero grant-state mismatches
- 1.7% missing quarter identifiers (imputed)
- 2.1% records with negative disbursements (corrected or excluded)
- 3.4% records with negative expenditures (corrected or excluded)
- 12.0% records with negative obligations (early reporting artifacts, corrected)

After cleaning and aggregation to the grantee-disaster level, the final analysis panel of 152 observations has no missing values for the key capacity indicators or survival analysis variables.

## A.4 Data Cleaning

The following cleaning steps were applied:

1. Removed total rows (aggregated across quarters)
2. Filtered to grantees with at least 4 quarters of reporting
3. Excluded records with zero obligated amounts
4. Winsorized extreme ratio values at 1st and 99th percentiles
