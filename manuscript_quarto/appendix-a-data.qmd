# Appendix A: Data Description {.unnumbered}

## A.1 Data Sources

### Quarterly Performance Reports (QPR)

The QPR data is extracted from HUD's DRGR (Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting) system. This administrative data captures:

- Fund allocations by appropriation
- Obligation, disbursement, and expenditure amounts
- Activity types (housing, infrastructure, economic development, etc.)
- Quarterly reporting periods

### Population Data

Population figures are obtained from:

- U.S. Census Bureau decennial census (2000, 2010, 2020)
- American Community Survey estimates for intercensal years

### Disaster Severity

The disaster severity index is constructed from:

- FEMA declared disaster data
- Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) obligations
- Number of affected counties

### Experience Indicators

Grantee experience measures are computed from:

- Years since first CDBG-DR grant
- Number of prior disaster grants managed
- Cumulative prior obligated dollars

## A.2 Variable Construction

### Financial Ratios

$$
\text{Ratio\_disbursed\_to\_obligated} = \frac{\text{Total Disbursed}}{\text{Total Obligated}}
$$

$$
\text{Ratio\_expended\_to\_disbursed} = \frac{\text{Total Expended}}{\text{Total Disbursed}}
$$

### Duration Measures

Duration is computed as the number of months from first obligation to reaching 95% expenditure of the final obligated amount. Log-transformation is applied to address right-skewness:

$$
\text{Duration\_log} = \ln(\text{Duration\_months})
$$

### Spending Consistency

The coefficient of variation (CV) measures spending consistency:

$$
\text{Spending\_CV} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{quarterly}}}{\mu_{\text{quarterly}}}
$$

## A.3 Sample Characteristics

[Include sample characteristics tables]

## A.4 Data Cleaning

The following cleaning steps were applied:

1. Removed total rows (aggregated across quarters)
2. Filtered to grantees with at least 4 quarters of reporting
3. Excluded records with zero obligated amounts
4. Winsorized extreme ratio values at 1st and 99th percentiles
