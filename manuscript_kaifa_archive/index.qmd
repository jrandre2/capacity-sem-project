title: "Modeling State and Local Governmental Capacity in Managing CDBG-DR Funds: A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Approach"
---


# Abstract {.unnumbered}


This study investigates how state and local governments across the
United States mobilize and manage federal CDBG-DR (Community Development
Block Grant-Disaster Recovery) resources using quarterly QPR (Quarterly
Performance Reports) data on funds obligated, disbursed, and expended in
response to 2003-2023 disasters. By constructing average ratios of
disbursed-to-obligated and expended-to-disbursed funds, the analysis
develops comparable indicators of governmental capacity and
fund-management performance across 78 disaster-affected jurisdictions.
To examine how these capacity measures shape disaster recovery
performance, the study applies both cross-sectional and longitudinal
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to model latent constructs of
governmental capacity and recovery outcomes at the state and local
levels.

The cross-sectional SEM results reveal clear differences in
administrative capacity across levels of government. State governments
consistently demonstrate stronger capacity to move funds from obligation
to disbursement and to fully expend obligated amounts, and these
capacity indicators show a stable, positive association with recovery
outcomes across multiple model specifications. Local governments, by
contrast, exhibit lower disbursement capacity and greater variability in
administrative processes; their recovery outcomes are more sensitive to
expenditure consistency and project-level timeliness. Sensitivity
analyses removing highly collinear indicators, such as duration of
completion, further show that state-level capacity-outcome relationships
remain robust, whereas local-level relationships are more fragile and
dependent on operational constraints.

Together, these findings highlight persistent capacity disparities
across jurisdictions and underscore the importance of targeted
administrative support for local program implementation. As a next step,
the study will extend the SEM framework into a longitudinal SEM design
to capture how governmental capacity evolves over time, assess whether
jurisdictions improve their fund-management efficiency with program
experience, and more directly examine dynamic pathways linking
administrative capability to long-term disaster recovery performance.

# Introduction


The effective administration of federal disaster recovery funds is
central to advancing equitable and timely community recovery. In the
United States, the Community Development Block Grant--Disaster Recovery
(CDBG-DR) program has become one of the largest and most flexible
sources of long-term recovery assistance following major disaster
declarations. Yet despite its national importance, the pace at which
grantees -- states, counties, cities, and territories -- obligate,
disburse, and expend CDBG-DR funds varies markedly across jurisdictions
and disaster events. Slow or inconsistent financial performance has been
repeatedly linked to delayed housing reconstruction, prolonged
displacement, uneven economic recovery, and persistent inequities for
low-income households and historically marginalized communities (GAO,
2019; HUD OIG, 2021).

A central challenge is that governmental "capacity" in disaster recovery
is difficult to measure directly. Previous evaluations often rely on
single-period financial indicators or case-based assessments, making it
difficult to compare capacity across time, jurisdictions, and disaster
contexts. The Quarterly Performance Reports (QPRs) submitted through
HUD's Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system offer a rare
opportunity to construct longitudinal, comparable indicators. These
reports consistently document obligated, disbursed, and expended amounts
for each grantee and activity, providing rich panel data for assessing
financial performance. However, raw financial quantities alone cannot
capture the multidimensional nature of administrative capacity, which
includes efficiency, timeliness, and internal process management.

To address these issues, this study develops a longitudinal Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) framework to conceptualize, quantify, and
compare governmental capacity in managing CDBG-DR funds. Using quarterly
data on obligations, disbursements, expenditures, efficiency ratios, and
temporal lags, we define capacity as a latent construct that evolves
over time and varies across state and local governments responding to
different disaster types. The study proceeds by: (1) conducting a
descriptive analysis of quarterly fund flows; (2) constructing
operational indicators of financial efficiency and timeliness; and (3)
estimating a SEM with latent governmental capacity to evaluate
cross-jurisdictional and cross-hazard differences.

This approach advances the literature in three ways. First, it offers a
systematic and empirically grounded measurement of administrative
capacity using longitudinal financial data, correcting for measurement
error, and capturing temporal dynamics. Second, it provides a
comparative framework to assess differences between state and local
grantees and across disaster contexts. Third, it develops practical
diagnostic indicators -- ratios and lags -- that can be readily
incorporated into HUD's monitoring and technical-assistance processes.
Together, these contributions help clarify how administrative capacity
shapes financial performance and recovery outcomes, offering new
insights for policy reform and institutional support programs.

# Literature Review


## Context: CDBG-DR administration and performance challenges


CDBG-DR has expanded substantially over the last two decades,
distributing billions of dollars following major hurricanes, floods,
wildfires, and other disasters. As a block-grant program, it affords
grantees considerable flexibility, but this flexibility also introduces
substantial administrative burden. Numerous evaluations have documented
persistent delays in grant implementation, including slow procurement,
environmental reviews, and program startups (GAO, 2019; HUD, 2020).
Grantees differ considerably in their experience with federal recovery
programs, staffing levels, contracting capacity, and administrative
processes -- all factors that influence the speed and effectiveness of
fund deployment (Zhang & Peacock, 2019; Howell & Elliott, 2019).

HUD requires quarterly reporting through the DRGR/QPR system, which
captures obligated, disbursed, and expended amounts by activity and
period. These data are widely used by auditors, HUD staff, and
researchers to assess financial performance. However, prior analyses
generally rely on descriptive summaries or aggregate comparisons rather
than modeling the underlying determinants or latent dimensions of
administrative capacity.

## Characteristics of disaster recovery administration


In general, three consistent characteristics emerge in the fields of
disaster recovery administration. (1) Significant cross-grantee
variation: Grantees differ widely in their pace of obligations,
disbursements, and expenditures. Prior experience with CDBG-DR or
similar programs is often associated with faster deployment (GAO, 2019).
(2) Differences between state and local administration: Some studies
note that local governments may be more responsive in certain housing
programs, whereas states may be more effective in infrastructure or
regional projects (Peacock et al., 2022). However, evidence remains
mixed due to methodological limitations and inconsistent measures. (3)
Administrative processes strongly influence timelines: Delays often stem
from procurement rules, environmental reviews, inconsistent staffing,
and challenges in coordinating across agencies (Smith & Martin, 2021).
Institutional capacity -- not only disaster severity -- plays a critical
role in shaping the speed of recovery.

Despite substantial progress, key gaps persist in the literature: (1)
There is a lack of a latent, multidimensional measure of administrative
capacity, as no studies integrate multiple performance indicators
(obligations, disbursements, expenditures, ratios, and timing lags) into
a unified latent construct. (2) Longitudinal and comparative analyses
remain limited; instead, most studies rely on static indicators or short
time windows, while longitudinal modeling that captures capacity growth,
learning effects, or decline over time remains unexplored. (3) There is
an urgent need to conduct cross-hazard and cross-jurisdiction
comparisons because existing analyses rarely compare performance across
disaster types, nor do they consistently evaluate how state and local
governments differ in their time-varying capacity. (4) Existing studies
exhibit a weak operational linkage between research metrics and
management tools. For instance, although QPR data are widely used, there
are no established diagnostic indicators for HUD or grantees that link
observed financial performance to underlying capacity indicators in a
validated way.

## Methods used in prior scholarship


Research on disaster recovery administration has primarily used four
methodological approaches. (1) Descriptive and programmatic analyses:
HUD and GAO frequently publish summaries highlighting differences in
fund utilization rates across grantees (GAO, 2019; HUD, 2020). Academic
and think-tank studies also document patterns in program launch times,
housing completions, and expenditure trajectories (Enterprise Community
Partners, 2024). These analyses reveal substantial variation but do not
explain the institutional factors that drive performance. (2)
Regression-based and panel analyses: Many public administration and
planning studies use regression or panel models to examine how staffing,
experience, governance type, or disaster severity influence
implementation speed (Pipa, 2020; Gerber & Robinson, 2022). While
informative, these models treat financial indicators as observed
outcomes without addressing measurement errors or the possibility that
capacity itself is a latent construct reflected by multiple correlated
indicators.

\(3\) Case studies and qualitative evaluations: Qualitative studies
offer deep insights into administrative processes, identifying barriers
such as restrictive procurement rules, complex environmental reviews,
and coordination challenges among agencies (Smith & Martin, 2021;
Peacock et al., 2022). These studies provide context but are not
designed for comparative or longitudinal generalization. (4)
Latent-variable and SEM approaches: In disaster studies more broadly,
SEM has been used to measure constructs such as preparedness, perceived
risk, and institutional resilience (Geddam et al., 2024; Cutter et al.,
2019). However, applications of SEM to federal disaster-recovery
finance, especially using QPR longitudinal data, remain extremely
limited. No existing study develops a latent, time-varying measure of
governmental capacity using efficiency ratios and financial timing
indicators.

## Research gaps and workflow


In summary, there remains an unaddressed need to use longitudinal
modeling and comparative analyses for offering a comprehensive
understanding of state and local governmental capacity to manage the
flow of obligated, disbursed, and expended CDBG-DR funds, particularly
regarding efficiency ratios and timeliness across administrative
jurisdictions and disaster events. Therefore, this study directly
addresses this gap by constructing a quarterly, latent measure of
governmental capacity from QPR data and estimating a longitudinal SEM to
evaluate differences across jurisdictions and hazard types. By
integrating efficiency ratios, expenditure timing lags, and quarterly
variability into a unified analytic framework, the study establishes a
rigorous, replicable, and policy-relevant method for understanding
administrative capacity in disaster recovery.

# Data and Research Design


## Data description and sources


The dataset, sourced from the quarterly performance reports (QPR) of
HUD's Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system, covers quarterly
obligated, disbursed, and expended CDBG-DR funds across 78 states and
local governments (grantees) and 18 disaster events spanning from 2001
to 2023. Each data row represents the set of obligated, disbursed, and
expended QPR funds for one disaster recovery program or activity
administered by a grantee in response to one disaster event. Notably,
obligated QPR funds refer to the amount of federal funding that HUD has
formally committed to a grantee for eligible disaster recovery
activities, and these funds are reserved but not yet spent. Disbursed
QPR funds refer to the amount of money that has been reimbursed or
transferred from HUD to the grantee after expenditures are reported and
approved, showing the federal government's completed payment to the
grantee. Expended QPR funds refer to the portion of obligated funds that
the grantee has already spent on approved recovery activities, which
reflects actual financial outlays.

Since these QPR fund data are quarterly and program-specific, this study
has a panel (time-series cross-sectional) structure. To describe the
overall capacity of both state and local governments, we separately
calculated the quarterly cumulative values of obligated, disbursed, and
expended QRP funds across different disaster recovery programs for each
grantee. With the processed dataset, this study focuses on both state-
and county-level data to model and compare state and local governmental
capacity in managing CDBG-DR funds. Similarly, to compare and analyze
governmental capacity in certain disaster recovery programs, we
calculated the quarterly cumulative values of obligated, disbursed, and
expended QPR funds for each grantee, separately for housing,
administration, infrastructure, and planning programs.

## Indicators of governmental capacity


In this study, state and local governmental capacity in managing CDBG-DR
funds cannot be directly observed from the dataset, but it manifests
through how efficiently and consistently funds move from obligation,
disbursement, to expenditure across time and programs. Therefore, to
model state and local governmental capacity, we put forward several
possible latent constructs as follows: (1) Administrative/managerial
capacity, which can be measured through the ratio of disbursed to
obligated funds, the ratio of expended to disbursed funds, and the
timeliness (lag) between each stage; (2) Program performance, which can
be measured by the speed and completeness of fund expenditure per
quarter.

The applications of these latent constructs are reflected in the
following ways: (1) using descriptive statistics to describe the overall
and program-specific capacity of state and local governments, capture
the change over time, and further compare and analyze their differences;
(2) incorporating these latent constructs into longitudinal modeling
(e.g., SEM) to quantify and compare state and local governmental
capacity in disaster recovery, and further analyze possible contributing
factors to the performance of state and local governmental capacity.

## Metrics of disaster recovery program outcomes


In this study, disaster recovery program outcomes are characterized by
the average duration of completion in months across disaster events, the
average percentage of obligated funds fully expended, and the average
quarterly-by-quarterly variance of expended funds. Specifically, the
duration of completion is equal to the time difference between the start
quarter (the quarter when the funds were first obligated) and the end
quarter (the earlier one between the current quarter and the quarter
when over 95% of obligated funds were fully expended). The percentage of
obligated funds fully expended equals the ratio of total expended funds
to total obligated funds. The quarterly-by-quarterly variance of
expended funds refers to the normalized standard deviation of quarterly
expended funds, indicating the smoothness of managing quarterly funds.

## Research design


Based on the processed dataset and capacity indicators, we conducted the
following research design to capture state and local governmental
capacity to manage CDBG-DR funds:

- To conduct a descriptive analysis of quarterly variations in QPR funds
  across local and state governments for different disaster events. This
  includes comparing obligated, expended, and disbursed funds; financial
  performance among selected states (e.g., California, Florida, Georgia,
  and Texas); and responses across different disaster events.

- To compute ratios of QPR fund disbursed/obligated and
  expended/disbursed, as well as lags of time difference between QPR
  fund obligation and expenditure. This creates latent variables at each
  time point when modeling quarterly capacity.

- To develop a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with latent constructs
  of governmental capacity to quantify and compare the differences in
  the capacity of state and local governments in responding to different
  disaster events over time.

# Methodology: Structural Equation Modeling


In this study, we use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to model and
quantify state and local governmental capacity in managing CDBG-DR
funds, given longitudinal quarterly data on obligated, disbursed, and
expended amounts across multiple programs. Therefore, the goal is to
capture state and local governmental capacity as a latent construct
reflected in how funds are allocated and utilized over time.

## Modeling approaches: Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal SEM


Cross-sectional SEM is used to analyze the overall capacity of state or
local governments across quarters, specifically creating a
latent variable *StateGovCapacity* or *LocalGovCapacity* measured by
quarterly average ratios or indicators (the average ratio of disbursed
to obligated funds across quarters, the average ratio of expended to
disbursed funds across quarters, and the average timeliness across
disaster events -- an inverse to the duration of completion).
The goal is to model relationships between state or local governmental
capacity and disaster recovery program outcomes (the average
duration of completion in months across disaster events, the average
percentage of obligated funds fully expended, and the average
quarterly-by-quarterly variance of expended funds). Notably, the
duration of completion is equal to the time difference between the start
quarter (the quarter when the funds were first obligated) and the end
quarter (the earlier one between the current quarter and the quarter
when over 95% of obligated funds were fully expended); The percentage of
obligated funds fully expended equals to the ratio of total expended
funds to total obligated funds; The quarterly-by-quarterly variance of
expended funds refers to the normalized standard deviation of quarterly
expended funds, indicating smoothness of managing quarterly funds. For
cross-sectional SEM, we aggregated each average of these indicators at a
grantee level (e.g., each state or local government) across different
disaster events and disaster recovery programs. Therefore, it cannot
capture the change of state or local governmental capacity to manage
CDBG-DR funds over time.

![Illustration of the cross-sectional structural equation modeling (SEM) for modeling the relationship between state or local governmental capacity and disaster recovery program outcomes.](figures/fig_01_cross_sectional_sem.png){#fig-cross-sectional-sem}


In contrast, a longitudinal SEM is developed to investigate how state or
local governmental capacity changes over time, specifically measuring
each ratio or indicator at multiple quarters and applying these data to
the latent growth curve model (LGCM) or autoregressive latent trajectory
(ALT) model to quantify and characterize the latent constructs of state
or local governmental capacity to manage CDBG-DR funds for disaster
recovery. In the modeling process, this study also includes control
variables such as population size, disaster magnitude, and
administrative staffing to improve SEM performance and add explanatory
power of the latent constructs of state or local governmental capacity.
Additionally, cross-lagged effects are also incorporated into SEM to
examine causality between fund stages and explain the efficiency and
timeliness of CDBG-DR funds.

## Experimental design and model evaluation


The SEM approach is implemented in the following ways: (1) to apply
quarterly average ratios or indicators and control variables to
cross-sectional SEM to evaluate the overall capacity of state or local
governmental capacity; (2) to use quarterly ratios or indicators and
control variables to longitudinal SEM to quantify the change of state or
local governmental capacity over time; (3) to use multi-group SEM to
compare state or local governmental capacity differences across regions,
disaster events, and program types (e.g., housing, administration,
infrastructure, and planning programs).

To evaluate SEM performance, this study introduces three fit indices,
such as Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), to assess
how well SEM approach captures the data structure and models the
relationships between state or local governmental capacity and disaster
recovery program outcomes. Specifically, CFI compares the fit of a
target model to a null model, with values greater than 0.96 indicating a
good fit. RMSEA measures the fit of a model relative to the sample data,
with lower values indicating a better fit. AIC refers to an index of
relative model fit, with the preferred model being the one with the
lowest AIC value.

## Model interpretation


The outcomes of the cross-sectional SEM will output estimates of latent
constructs of governmental capacity, which reflect the overall average
capacity of state or local governments to manage CDBG-DR funds across
quarters. Additionally, we can compare the differences in state or local
governmental capacity and further identify and analyze possible
contributing factors to the overall governmental capacity differences.

In contrast, based on the longitudinal SEM, we can estimate an intercept
to describe the baseline capacity of state or local governments and a
slope to capture the change in governmental capacity over time.
Specifically, baseline capacity (the estimated intercept) describes how
capable jurisdictions were at the start, while change rate (the
estimated slope) assesses whether they are improving or declining in
managing CDBG-DR funds. Additionally, we can also estimate path
coefficients to indicate how state or local governmental capacity
influences disaster recovery program outcomes, as well as possible
contributing factors to governmental capacity and its change over time.
With this information, we can answer the following question: "Are some
jurisdictions improving in capacity over time while others stagnate?"

# Results


## Empirical comparison of governmental capacity


The 2017 hurricane season -- including major events such as Harvey,
Irma, and Maria -- along with a series of 2018 disaster events such as
windstorms, wildfires, drought, flooding, mudslides, and seismic
hazards, caused widespread devastation across the United States. These
events resulted in substantial infrastructure damage, economic
disruption, and loss of life. States like Florida and Texas were among
the most severely affected: Florida faced repeated and destructive
storms, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and additional events in 2018,
while Texas endured catastrophic impacts from Hurricane Harvey, one of
the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.

Given the scale and complexity of these disasters, examining how
governments manage QPR-reported recovery funds offers valuable and
representative insights into their capacity to implement disaster
recovery programs. Studying and comparing governmental performance in
administering these funds across the 2017 and 2018 events helps
illuminate strengths, gaps, and variations in recovery management --
critical for improving future disaster readiness and response.

### Quarterly average ratios of disbursed/obligated and expended/disbursed funds


Figure 2 illustrates substantial variation in how state and local
governments managed QPR funds following the 2017 hurricanes. Florida and
California exhibit the strongest overall administrative capacity,
maintaining the highest Disbursed/Obligated ratios (\~0.48-0.50), while
Puerto Rico shows the lowest performance at roughly 0.21, indicating
slower movement of obligated funds into active disbursement. Texas --
GLO and the Virgin Islands fall in the middle range, though still below
California and Florida.

Across all governments, the Expended/Disbursed ratio is consistently
high -- generally between 0.90 and 1.10 -- suggesting that once funds
are disbursed, they are effectively expended. Florida and Texas -- GLO
exceed 1.0 on average, reflecting rapid or catch-up expenditure
activity, whereas Missouri and the Virgin Islands fall slightly lower
but still retain strong expenditure efficiency. In summary, the major
differences lie in governments' ability to convert obligations into
disbursements, while expenditure performance after disbursement remains
uniformly strong.

![Illustration of quarterly average ratios of disbursed/obligated and expended/disbursed funds across different governments in response to the 2017 Hurricanes.](figures/fig_02_2017_hurricanes_ratios.png){#fig-2017-hurricanes-ratios}


Figure 3 shows a wide variation in governments' ability to move funds
through the disaster recovery pipeline in 2018. Disbursed/Obligated
ratios are generally low, with most governments disbursing less than
half of what they obligate. Performance ranges from very limited
disbursement in Hawaii County, American Samoa, and California (around
0.1--0.2) to relatively strong performance in North Carolina -- NCORR,
Wisconsin, and the "rogco" jurisdiction, which approaches or exceeds
0.6-1.0.

In contrast, Expended/Disbursed ratios remain consistently high across
governments, indicating that once funds are disbursed, they are
efficiently spent. Values hover near or above 1.0 for most
jurisdictions, with particularly high ratios in Alaska and rogco (near
2.0), suggesting rapid expenditure relative to disbursement. Overall,
governments differ substantially in their ability to convert obligations
into disbursements, while their expenditure efficiency after
disbursement remains uniformly strong.

![Illustration of quarterly average ratios of disbursed/obligated and expended/disbursed funds across different governments in response to the 2018 disasters.](figures/fig_03_2018_disasters_ratios.png){#fig-2018-disasters-ratios}


Across both years, governments consistently show high Expended/Disbursed
ratios, meaning that once funds are released, they are spent
efficiently. The key difference lies in Disbursed/Obligated performance:
2017 governments -- especially Florida and California -- generally
disbursed a larger share of obligated funds, while many 2018 governments
had much lower disbursement levels, with only a few (e.g., NCORR, rogco)
performing strongly. Overall, the main capacity gap in both years is
slow disbursement, not expenditure efficiency.

### Quarterly variations in QPR funds across state governments


Based on the findings from 5.1.1, we selected the four common states --
California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas -- to further compare and
analyze QPR-reported quarterly obligated, disbursed, and expended funds
in response to both the 2017 Hurricanes and 2018 disasters, offering a
more comprehensive understanding of the overall capacity of different
state governments to manage QPR funds.

2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria

The quarterly QPR data reveal distinct funding trajectories across
California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas after the 2017 hurricane season,
reflecting differences in disaster severity, federal allocation size,
and state administrative capacity, as shown in Figure 4.

*Scale of allocation and initial obligations*: Texas and Florida -- both
heavily impacted by major hurricanes -- show the largest and fastest
increases in obligated funds, highlighting the scale of damages and the
urgency of federal support. For instance, Texas experienced an immediate
surge to more than \$4.5 billion in obligations by late 2018, driven by
the extensive destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey. Florida recorded a
substantial but smaller increase, with obligations exceeding \$300
million early in the recovery period, reflecting the widespread impacts
of Hurricane Irma. In contrast, California and Georgia, which received
smaller CDBG-DR allocations tied to unmet needs and indirect impacts,
show slower, more incremental obligation patterns. Georgia's obligations
grow steadily over several years, while California's mid-cycle increase
reflects later-awarded mitigation-oriented funds that required program
setup before ramping up.

![Quarterly variations of QPR funds obligated, disbursed, and expended in California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas in response to the 2017 Hurricanes](figures/fig_04_2017_hurricanes_quarterly_variation.png){#fig-2017-hurricanes-quarterly}


*Pace of expenditures and disbursements*: Differences in expenditure and
disbursement trajectories illustrate how each state structured its
programs and sequenced its recovery activities. Texas shows the most
sustained and linear upward trend, with expenditures surpassing \$4
billion by 2025 -- consistent with long-term housing reconstruction,
buyouts, and large infrastructure projects. Florida displays a similar
pattern on a smaller scale, driven by ongoing statewide housing recovery
initiatives. California records moderate expenditure growth associated
with housing, utility resilience, and mitigation programs. Georgia
maintains the smallest but steadily increasing expenditures, reflecting
consistent execution within a limited funding envelope.

*Relationship between obligations, expenditures, and disbursements*:
Across all states, expenditures and disbursements move closely together,
indicating effective conversion of obligated funds into active projects.
However, timing and magnitude differ: Texas shows the largest early gap
between obligations and expenditures, aligning with rapid obligation of
major program budgets followed by multiyear construction cycles. Florida
demonstrates a closer alignment between obligations and expenditures,
suggesting more incremental spending and shorter project timelines.
California and Georgia display smaller but proportionate spending
patterns, consistent with narrower and more targeted program scopes.

Overall, the four-state comparison shows how disaster severity,
allocation size, and program design shape financial trajectories in the
QPR system. Specifically, Texas emerges as the most rapid and largest
allocator of funds, reflecting unprecedented hurricane impacts. Florida
follows as a major, though more moderate, recovery case. California and
Georgia represent smaller, targeted recovery programs that progressed
steadily across the reporting period. Together, these patterns highlight
the need to align federal recovery allocations with actual disaster
impacts and illustrate the varied administrative timelines states
require to translate obligations into measurable recovery outcomes.

2018 Disasters

The quarterly QPR data show how California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas
-- GLO managed CDBG-DR funds allocated for the 2018 disaster recovery
programs, as shown in Figure 5. The trajectories illustrate differences
in allocation size, pace of program rollout, and administrative
capacity.

![Quarterly variations of QPR funds obligated, disbursed, and expended in California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas in response to the 2018 disasters](figures/fig_05_2018_disasters_quarterly_variation.png){#fig-2018-disasters-quarterly}


*Scale of allocation and initial obligations*: Obligation levels vary
considerably across the four states, reflecting differences in the scale
of 2018 disaster impacts and federal allocations. For instance,
California shows the largest and most rapid growth in obligations,
rising sharply to nearly \$1 billion by late 2024, driven by substantial
allocations for wildfire recovery and mitigation. Florida records
significant obligations as well, increasing to over \$700 million,
reflecting extensive impacts from Hurricanes Michael and other 2018
storms. Georgia exhibits a much smaller obligation footprint, gradually
rising to just above \$40 million, consistent with a more limited set of
affected areas. Texas -- GLO demonstrates moderate but steady obligation
growth, reaching approximately \$65 million, corresponding to targeted
programs addressing localized 2018 flood and storm damage.

*Pace of expenditures and disbursements*: The expenditure and
disbursement trajectories indicate how each state translated obligated
funds into active project spending. Specifically, California shows a
steady and gradual rise in both expenditures and disbursements,
reflecting multi-year wildfire and mitigation projects that required
extended planning before full implementation. Florida demonstrates a
stronger and more consistent increase in spending, with expenditures
closely tracking obligations -- indicative of large-scale housing and
infrastructure recovery programs rolling out steadily. Georgia shows
modest but continuous growth in expenditures and disbursements,
signaling stable progress within a relatively small program. Texas --
GLO shows accelerated spending beginning in 2023, with disbursements and
expenditures rising in parallel, reflecting the ramp-up of targeted
recovery activities.

*Relationship between obligations, expenditures, and disbursements*:
Patterns across the four states highlight varying administrative
timelines and program structures. California demonstrates a widening gap
between obligations and expenditures after 2023, consistent with the
long lead time typical of mitigation and wildfire resilience projects.
Florida shows the closest alignment among the three metrics, reflecting
incremental obligation practices and relatively rapid conversion of
funds into active spending. Georgia maintains proportionate
relationships across all metrics, consistent with a narrow program scope
and steady implementation pace. Texas -- GLO shows an initial lag
between obligations and expenditures, followed by stronger convergence
as spending accelerates in 2023-2024.

Overall, the four-state comparison demonstrates how differences in
disaster scale and program design shaped QPR-reported financial
management: California shows the largest and most rapid obligation
growth, driven by severe wildfire impacts and significant mitigation
investments. Florida represents a major, steadily progressing recovery
program with strong alignment between obligations and expenditures.
Georgia reflects a small but consistently executed program with
proportional spending. Texas -- GLO shows a targeted program that gained
momentum over time as expenditures increased. Together, these patterns
highlight the varied administrative trajectories states follow as they
move from federal allocations to on-the-ground recovery outcomes for
2018 disaster events.

### Latent constructs of state governmental capacity for 2017 & 2018 disaster recovery programs


Following the SEM structure illustrated in Figure 1, the model
incorporating three measures of governmental capacity and three
indicators of disaster recovery outcomes -- based on data from seven
state governments responding to the 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and
Maria -- exhibited poor model fit, as shown in Figure 6. The
goodness-of-fit statistics (CFI = 0.1808, RMSEA = 2.1299, AIC =
--38.5003) indicate that the specified relationships do not adequately
reflect the underlying data structure. Although the estimated paths
suggest that higher governmental capacity may be associated with
improved recovery outcomes, these results are not reliable. The primary
limitation is the extremely small sample size, which introduces
substantial estimation uncertainty and constrains the model's ability to
generate stable and interpretable parameter estimates.

![Illustration of SEM outputs of state governmental capacity to manage QPR funds for 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.](figures/fig_06_sem_state_2017_hurricanes.png){#fig-sem-state-2017}


As shown in Figure 7, the SEM estimated using data from thirteen
state/local governments responding to the 2018 disasters demonstrates a
comparatively better statistical fit. The goodness-of-fit indices (CFI =
0.6201, RMSEA = 0.6705, AIC = 18.1289) suggest that the model captures
part of the underlying data structure, although it still falls short of
conventional thresholds for acceptable fit. Notably, several path
coefficients indicate that greater governmental capacity is associated
with poorer recovery outcomes -- an unexpected result that contradicts
theory and practical experience. This counterintuitive pattern is
largely attributable to methodological limitations, including the small
sample size and the combination of state and local governments within a
single model, both of which introduce substantial estimation uncertainty
and hinder the generation of stable, meaningful parameter estimates.

## Comparison of overall capacity of state/local governments


### Measurements of governmental capacity: Average ratios of QPR fund disbursed/obligated and expended/disbursed


State government:

Figure 8 summarizes how state governments managed QPR funds across
disaster events from 2003-2023 using two key indicators of
administrative capacity. The Disbursed/Obligated ratio is generally low
and clustered between 0.2 and 0.7 for most states, indicating that many
governments disburse only a portion of obligated funds each quarter,
with wide variation in their ability to convert obligations into
actionable spending. In contrast, the Expended/Disbursed ratio is
consistently high -- typically between 0.8 and 1.5 -- showing that once
funds are disbursed, most states are effective at expending them. A few
extreme values, such as Mississippi's unusually high expenditure ratio,
reflect irregular reporting or one-time spending spikes rather than
sustained performance. Overall, the figure demonstrates that the primary
capacity challenge for state governments lies in timely disbursement,
while their expenditure efficiency after disbursement remains strong
across nearly all jurisdictions.

Local government:

Figure 9 presents two key indicators of local governmental capacity in
managing QPR funds across disaster events from 2003-2023. Overall, local
governments exhibit low and tightly clustered Disbursed/Obligated
ratios, typically below 0.5, indicating that most jurisdictions disburse
only a modest share of obligated funds each quarter. In contrast,
Expended/Disbursed ratios are consistently high, generally falling
between 0.8 and 1.5, suggesting strong expenditure efficiency once funds
are disbursed. Several extreme spikes -- for example in Detroit (MI) and
San Marcos (TX) -- reflect irregular reporting or one-time expenditure
surges rather than sustained performance patterns.

Compared with state governments, local governments show even lower
disbursement capacity but similarly strong expenditure performance. This
contrast highlights a systematic pattern: both state and local
governments are effective at spending funds after disbursement, but
local jurisdictions face greater challenges in moving obligated dollars
into active use, likely due to more limited administrative resources,
staffing, and program management capacity.

### Latent constructs of governmental capacity: Cross-sectional SEM


State government:

As shown in Figure 10, the SEM estimated using data from 38 state
governments responding to disasters between 2003 and 2023 demonstrates a
considerably stronger model fit compared with earlier models. The
goodness-of-fit indices (CFI = 0.8602, RMSEA = 0.3141, AIC = 24.0418)
indicate that the specified relationships capture much of the underlying
data structure and meaningfully reflect how state governments manage QPR
funds.

The path estimates reveal a positive and statistically significant
relationship between state governmental capacity and overall recovery
outcomes (*β* = 71.024, *p* = 0.01). This suggests that states with
stronger administrative capacity -- measured through their ability to
disburse, expend, and timely process QPR funds -- tend to achieve more
favorable recovery performance. Although not all individual capacity
indicators load equally onto the latent construct (e.g., timeliness and
expended/disbursed show weaker contributions), the model still
identifies a coherent underlying dimension of administrative
effectiveness.

On the outcome side, the latent recovery construct is shaped by multiple
program performance indicators, including duration of completion,
quarter-to-quarter expenditure stability, and the share of fully
expended obligated funds. The significant loading on the latter (*β* =
0.017, *p* = 0.00) indicates that effective and full expenditure of
obligated funds is a key driver of stronger recovery outcomes.

Taken together, the SEM supports the interpretation that states with
higher capacity -- those able to move funds efficiently through the
stages of obligation, disbursement, and expenditure -- tend to implement
recovery programs more effectively. Although some relationships remain
modest or statistically weak, the overall model suggests that
administrative capacity is an important structural determinant of
disaster recovery performance at the state level.

![Illustration of SEM outputs of state governmental capacity to manage QPR funds across 2003-2023 disaster events.](figures/fig_10_sem_state_2003_2023.png){#fig-sem-state-2003-2023}


Local government:

As shown in Figure 11, the SEM estimated using data from 40 local
governments responding to disasters between 2003 and 2023 demonstrates a
moderately strong model fit. The goodness-of-fit indices (CFI = 0.7847,
RMSEA = 0.3027, AIC = 24.1708) indicate that the specified relationships
capture much of the underlying data structure, though not as robustly as
the state-level model.

The estimated paths suggest that local governmental capacity has a
positive and statistically significant effect on disaster recovery
outcomes (*β* = 223.685, *p* = 0.00). This indicates that local
jurisdictions with greater administrative capacity -- measured through
fund disbursement, expenditure patterns, and timeliness -- tend to
achieve better program performance. Among the observed indicators,
timeliness loads strongly and significantly onto local capacity,
suggesting that procedural efficiency plays a more central role for
local governments than for state governments. At the same time, the
expended/disbursed ratio shows a weaker contribution, reflecting the
high expenditure efficiency observed across most local jurisdictions and
therefore offering less discriminatory power in measuring capacity.

On the recovery side, the latent recovery outcome variable is shaped by
indicators such as duration of completion, quarter-to-quarter
expenditure stability, and the proportion of fully expended obligated
funds, with the latter showing a significant positive loading (*β* =
0.008, *p* = 0.00). This suggests that local governments demonstrating
consistent follow-through in spending obligated funds tend to achieve
stronger recovery outcomes.

![Illustration of SEM outputs of local governmental capacity to manage QPR funds across 2003-2023 disaster events.](figures/fig_11_sem_local_2003_2023.png){#fig-sem-local-2003-2023}


When compared with the state-level SEM, two differences emerge clearly.
First, the magnitude of the capacity effect is substantially larger for
local governments, implying that variations in administrative capability
play an even more decisive role at the local level, where staffing,
expertise, and program management resources are often more constrained.
Second, state models exhibit more balanced contributions across capacity
indicators, whereas the local model places greater weight on timeliness
and procedural efficiency -- core bottlenecks in local program
implementation.

Overall, the SEM results indicate that while both state and local
governments benefit from higher administrative capacity, the sensitivity
of recovery outcomes to capacity constraints is greater at the local
level. This highlights the importance of sustained technical assistance,
staffing support, and administrative investment for local governments
managing complex, long-term federal recovery programs.

### Latent constructs of governmental capacity: Cross-sectional SEM without duration of completion


Because timeliness, an indicator of governmental capacity, is strongly
correlated with duration of completion, an outcome measure, we removed
duration of completion from the SEM to reduce multicollinearity and
improve the robustness of the model. This adjustment allows for a
clearer separation between the latent constructs of capacity and
recovery performance, and it also serves as a sensitivity test for the
stability of the state- and local-level results.

State government:

As shown in Figure 12, the revised SEM -- estimated using data from 38
state governments responding to disasters between 2003 and 2023 --
exhibits improved model fit. The goodness-of-fit indices (CFI = 0.8470,
RMSEA = 0.2531, AIC = 21.2906) indicate that the simplified structure
captures most of the underlying data patterns and performs better than
the full model that included duration of completion.

Importantly, the path estimates reveal that state governmental capacity
continues to have a positive and statistically significant effect on
recovery outcomes even after removing the completion-time measure. The
disbursed/obligated ratio remains the strongest contributor to the
capacity construct and significantly predicts better recovery
performance (*β* = 1.235, *p* = 0.01). This underscores that, for state
governments, the ability to convert obligated funds into disbursed funds
is a critical driver of overall program success. Other measures -- such
as expended/disbursed and timeliness -- still load onto the capacity
construct, but with weaker influence, reflecting less variation across
states in later stages of fund expenditure.

Comparing the SEM results with and without duration of completion
highlights several meaningful differences. In the original model,
duration of completion played a substantial role in defining recovery
outcomes, and its strong correlation with timeliness risked overstating
the influence of administrative speed. In the revised model, recovery
outcomes are driven primarily by expenditure consistency and the
proportion of obligated funds fully expended, both of which remain
conceptually and empirically distinct from capacity indicators. The
persistence of significant relationships in the reduced model shows that
state-level capacity effects are stable and not dependent on the
inclusion of project completion times.

Overall, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that state governmental
capacity is strongly tied to financial throughput rather than project
duration, and that removing duration of completion strengthens the
clarity and reliability of the model. This contrasts with local
governments -- where recovery performance is more dependent on
timeliness and completion speed -- highlighting a fundamental difference
in how administrative capacity shapes outcomes across levels of
government.

![Illustration of SEM outputs of state governmental capacity to manage QPR funds across 2003-2023 disaster events.](figures/fig_12_sem_state_2003_2023_no_duration.png){#fig-sem-state-2003-2023-no-duration}


Local government:

As shown in Figure 13, the SEM estimated using data from 40 local
governments -- after removing duration of completion from the recovery
outcome construct -- produces a moderately improved statistical fit. The
goodness-of-fit indices (CFI = 0.5295, RMSEA = 0.6601, AIC = 18.4010)
indicate that although the model does not meet conventional fit
thresholds, it captures a meaningful portion of the underlying data
structure and performs worse than the full model that included duration
of completion. Removing this indicator helps reduce multicollinearity
with timeliness, one of the capacity measures, and increases the
interpretability of the local-level SEM results.

The path coefficients reveal a nuanced relationship between local
governmental capacity and disaster recovery outcomes. Local capacity,
defined by disbursement efficiency, expenditure efficiency, and
timeliness, shows a statistically significant and positive association
with recovery performance through the ratio of disbursed to obligated
funds (*β* = 1.199, *p* = 0.00). This reinforces that local
jurisdictions with stronger administrative ability to move funds early
in the grant cycle tend to achieve better program outcomes. However, the
expended-to-disbursed ratio and timeliness show weaker or marginal
contributions to the capacity construct (*p* = 0.14 and *p* = 0.05),
reflecting wide variability in local administrative processes and the
greater operational constraints faced by local governments.

On the recovery side, indicators such as quarter-to-quarter expenditure
stability and the share of fully expended obligated funds remain central
to defining recovery outcomes, with the latter demonstrating a strong
and stable loading across model specifications. This suggests that
consistent follow-through in spending obligated funds is a primary
marker of successful local recovery performance.

Comparing the SEM results with vs. without duration of completion
highlights an important shift: In the full model, duration of completion
strongly influenced the recovery construct, and its high correlation
with timeliness risked inflating the apparent role of administrative
speed. In the reduced model, the influence of timeliness weakens,
indicating that local recovery outcomes are shaped more by how
effectively funds are expended, rather than by project‐completion
timelines alone.

![Illustration of SEM outputs of local governmental capacity to manage QPR funds across 2003-2023 disaster events.](figures/fig_13_sem_local_2003_2023_no_duration.png){#fig-sem-local-2003-2023-no-duration}


When contrasted with state-level SEM results, additional differences
emerge. State governments show a stronger and more stable relationship
between capacity and recovery outcomes, even after removing duration of
completion. State capacity is driven largely by financial throughput --
especially disbursement efficiency -- and the effects remain significant
and consistent across sensitivity tests. By contrast, local governments
exhibit greater sensitivity to model specification: their
capacity-outcome relationship is more fragile and heavily shaped by
variability in timeliness and expenditure behavior.

Overall, the SEM results indicate that while both state and local
governments benefit from stronger administrative capacity, local
governments face greater operational constraints and exhibit less stable
capacity-outcome relationships when project duration is removed. This
underscores the need for targeted administrative support at the local
level, where limited staffing and procedural complexity can pose
persistent barriers to effective disaster recovery program management.

# Discussion


# Conclusions


This study developed a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework to
measure and quantify governmental capacity as a latent construct. Use
the model to compare differences in capacity across local and state
governments, identify potential structural or contextual factors driving
these differences, and offer evidence-based recommendations to improve
governmental capacity for future climate-related risks and disasters.
